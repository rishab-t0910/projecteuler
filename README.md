# projecteuler
This is the location to find all my Project Euler programs done in 2022. I did a few problems without the use of programming (choosing to find the solution mathematically) or in 2021 (for which I cannot find my code for). 

Arguably, some of the solutions are not the most optimal solutions. My goal was/is to first get a solution, even if that might be a brute force method.
